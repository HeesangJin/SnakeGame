# Snake Game UI Redesign: "Cosmic Cockpit" Theme

Please overhaul the current UI styling to match a **"Cosmic Cockpit" theme**. The player should feel like an astronaut playing a retro game on a futuristic screen inside a spaceship, surrounded by deep space.

Here are the specific styling guidelines:

## 1. Overall Theme & Background
* **Background:** Replace the solid background with a **dark, deep space scene**. Think stars, distant nebulae, and cosmic dust. A subtle, slow parallax effect or drifting stars would be amazing.
* **Overall Theme:** Dark mode, futuristic, sci-fi, glowing neon lights, high-tech controls.
* **Color Palette:** Deep blues, purples, and blacks for backgrounds. Bright neon cyan, green, and orange for interactive elements and lights.

## 2. Typography
* **Font Family:** Change all fonts to a **futuristic, sci-fi, or digital display style font** (e.g., like `Orbitron`, `Exo 2`, or a clean monospace font).
* **Text Color:** All text should be light (white or light cyan) to pop against the dark backgrounds. Add a subtle outer glow to important text like score numbers.

## 3. Scoreboard Card
* **Background:** Change the white panel to a **semi-transparent, dark blue or black glass panel**. It should look like a Heads-Up Display (HUD) screen.
* **Border & Effect:** Remove the soft shadow and add a **glowing neon cyan or blue border**. Add a subtle scanline effect or digital noise texture overlay to the panel.
* **Labels & Scores:** "Score" and "Best" labels should be smaller. The numbers should be large, glowing, digital-style digits.

## 4. Game Board area
* **Frame:** Transform the game board's border into a **glowing, high-tech monitor frame** inside the cockpit. Use a neon blue or green glow.
* **Grid Background:** The grid field should look like a **holographic projection in space**. Make the grid lines faint neon laser lines. The background behind the grid should be transparent or show a slightly distorted view of the space background.
* **Snake:**
    * Design the snake as a **train of glowing energy modules or futuristic spaceships**.
    * Use neon green or cyan for the body.
    * Make the **head distinctive**—maybe a cockpit window or a brighter thruster light.
    * Add a subtle glowing trail effect behind the snake.
* **Food:**
    * Change the food into a **glowing energy core, a small asteroid, or a cosmic collectible**.
    * Make it pulse with bright neon orange or red light, emitting a strong glow.

## 5. Game Over Overlay
* **Background:** Keep the dark overlay but make it look like a **system malfunction screen**. Add heavy digital noise, scanlines, or a red tint.
* **Text:** "GAME OVER" should be massive, flashing red or orange, possibly with a glitch effect.
* **Restart Button:** Make it a prominent, glowing red or orange emergency reset button.

## 6. Controls & Buttons
* **Style:** Redesign all buttons (Pause, Restart, D-pad) to look like **physical controls on a spaceship console**.
* **Appearance:** Use dark metallic or carbon fiber textures for the button background.
* **Icons/Text:** Use glowing neon icons (arrows, play/pause symbols) instead of plain text.
* **Interaction:** Add a strong **glowing effect and pressed state animation** when hovered or clicked, making them feel responsive and tactile.
